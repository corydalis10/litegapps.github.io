Magnetar Magisk Module is a magisk module that aims to provide an optimal experience in all usage scenarios for all magisk-rooted devices. It automatically controls the device using Machine Learning to adapt to the user's usage. A variety of features are also available to fit the user's preferences.

## Features

- **CPU Optimization**: Magnetar adjusts the CPU frequency, governor, and scheduler according to the device load and temperature. It also enables dynamic stune boost, schedutil, and CPU input boost for better responsiveness and performance.
- **GPU Optimization**: Magnetar optimizes the GPU frequency, governor, and power level based on the device usage and battery level. It also enables Adreno Boost, GPU input boost, and GPU thermal throttling for smoother gaming and graphics.
- **RAM Optimization**: Magnetar manages the RAM usage and allocation using zRAM, LMK, and KSM. It also enables ZRAM compression, ZRAM writeback, and ZRAM defragmentation for faster memory access and reduced swap usage.
- **Battery Optimization**: Magnetar extends the battery life by applying various tweaks such as Doze mode, Wakelock blocker, and Power saving mode. It also enables Battery idle mode, Battery charge limit, and Battery calibration for better battery health and longevity.
- **Miscellaneous Optimization**: Magnetar improves the overall device performance and stability by applying various tweaks such as FSync, I/O scheduler, TCP congestion algorithm, and SELinux mode. It also enables Fast charge, Sound control, and Vibration control for enhanced user experience.

## Installation

Magnetar requires the following to function properly:

- Magisk v23.0 or higher
- Busybox for Android NDK
