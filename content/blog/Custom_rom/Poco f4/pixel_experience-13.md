Pixel Experience is a custom ROM that aims to bring the features and look of Google's Pixel devices to other Android phones. It is based on the latest Android 13 version, which offers improved performance, security, and privacy. Pixel Experience also includes some exclusive features such as Pixel Launcher, Google Camera, Pixel Sounds, and more.

One of the devices that can run Pixel Experience 13 is the Poco F4, also known as the Redmi K40S in some regions. The Poco F4 is a mid-range phone that features a 6.67-inch AMOLED display, a Snapdragon 778G processor, a 64MP quad-camera setup, and a 5000mAh battery. It was launched with MIUI 12.5 based on Android 11, but some users may prefer a more stock-like experience.

In this article, we will review the Pixel Experience 13 ROM for the Poco F4, and see how it compares to the stock MIUI ROM. We will cover the installation process, the features, the performance, the battery life, and the camera quality of the ROM.

## Installation

To install Pixel Experience 13 on the Poco F4, you will need to unlock the bootloader, install a custom recovery, and flash the ROM zip file. You can follow the detailed guide [here](^1^) or watch the video tutorial [here](^3^). Make sure to backup your data before proceeding, as this will wipe your internal storage.

The latest build of Pixel Experience 13 for the Poco F4 is dated November 26, 2023, and has a size of 1.6GB. It is maintained by Jayanth Kandula, who also provides updates and bug fixes regularly. You can download the ROM from the official Pixel Experience website [here](^1^).

## Features

Pixel Experience 13 for the Poco F4 offers a clean and smooth user interface, with minimal bloatware and customization options. It comes with the Pixel Launcher, which has a swipe-up app drawer, a Google feed on the left, and an At a Glance widget on the top. You can also access the Google Assistant by swiping from the bottom corners.

The ROM also includes the Google Camera app, which has features such as HDR+, Night Sight, Portrait Mode, and Astrophotography. The camera quality is comparable to the stock MIUI camera, and sometimes even better in low-light conditions. You can also use other camera apps, such as GCam mods or ANXCamera, if you prefer.

Another feature of Pixel Experience 13 is the Pixel Sounds app, which lets you choose from a variety of ringtones, notifications, and alarms. You can also enable the Now Playing feature, which shows the song name and artist on the lock screen when music is playing in the background.

The ROM also supports some of the Poco F4's hardware features, such as the fingerprint scanner, the face unlock, the IR blaster, and the NFC. However, some features are missing or not working properly, such as the Always On Display, the ambient display, the edge lighting, and the Mi Sound Enhancer. These features are exclusive to MIUI, and may not be compatible with Pixel Experience.

## Performance

Pixel Experience 13 for the Poco F4 delivers a smooth and fast performance, with no noticeable lags or stutters. The ROM is optimized for the Snapdragon 778G chipset, which handles multitasking, gaming, and browsing with ease. The ROM also has a good thermal management, and does not overheat or throttle under heavy load.

The ROM also has a good memory management, and does not kill apps in the background too aggressively. You can switch between apps without reloading, and receive notifications from all apps. The ROM also supports the 120Hz refresh rate of the Poco F4's display, which makes the animations and transitions more fluid.

The ROM also has a good security and privacy, and comes with the latest Android security patch level of November 5, 2023. The ROM also supports encryption, and has a built-in Privacy Dashboard, which shows you how often apps access your location, camera, microphone, and other permissions. You can also use the Privacy Indicator, which shows a green dot on the status bar when an app is using the camera or microphone.

## Battery Life

Pixel Experience 13 for the Poco F4 has a decent battery life, but not as good as the stock MIUI ROM. The ROM has a slightly higher idle drain, and consumes more power when using the 120Hz refresh rate, the Google Camera, and the Google Services. The ROM also does not support the 33W fast charging of the Poco F4, and only charges at 18W.

The ROM does have some battery saving features, such as the Adaptive Battery, which limits the battery usage of apps that you don't use often, and the Extreme Battery Saver, which restricts the background activity and network access of apps. You can also use the Battery Saver mode, which reduces the performance, the brightness, and the refresh rate of the device.

The ROM also has a detailed Battery Usage graph, which shows you the battery level, the screen on time, and the app usage over time. You can also see the estimated battery life and the time to full charge on the lock screen and the status bar.

## Conclusion

Pixel Experience 13 for the Poco F4 is a great ROM for those who want a stock-like Android experience on their device. It offers a clean and smooth user interface, a good performance, a decent battery life, and a good camera quality. It also comes with some exclusive features, such as the Pixel Launcher, the Google Camera, the Pixel Sounds, and the Now Playing.

However, the ROM also has some drawbacks, such as the lack of some MIUI features, the lower fast charging speed, and the higher power consumption. The ROM also has some bugs and issues, such as the non-working Always On Display, the ambient display, the edge lighting, and the Mi Sound Enhancer. The ROM also may not receive official updates from Xiaomi, and may not support future Android versions.

Therefore, Pixel Experience 13 for the Poco F4 is a ROM that you can try if you are bored with MIUI, or if you prefer a more pure Android experience. However, if you are happy with MIUI, or if you need some of its features, you may want to stick with the stock ROM, or wait for a more stable and feature-rich Pixel Experience ROM in the future.
