LineageOS is one of the most popular custom ROMs for Android devices, offering a clean and stable experience with a lot of customization options. LineageOS 21 is the latest version of the ROM, based on Android 14, which brings new features and improvements to the system.

In this article, we will show you how to install LineageOS 21 on your Redmi Note 5 Pro, a mid-range smartphone from Xiaomi that was released in 2023. The Redmi Note 5 Pro has a 5.99-inch IPS LCD display, a Snapdragon 636 processor, 4GB or 6GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a dual rear camera setup with a 12MP main sensor and a 5MP depth sensor, a 20MP front camera, a 4000mAh battery, and a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner.

The Redmi Note 5 Pro is also known as whyred, which is its codename for LineageOS development. The official LineageOS 21 build for whyred is maintained by [TheScarastic](^1^), a recognized developer on XDA Forums. The ROM is updated weekly with bug fixes and security patches.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed with the installation, make sure you have the following:

- A Redmi Note 5 Pro with an unlocked bootloader and a custom recovery installed. You can follow to unlock the bootloader and [this guide](^3^) to install a custom recovery (we recommend TWRP).
- A backup of your data, as the installation will wipe your internal storage.
- A microSD card or a USB OTG drive with at least 4GB of free space, where you will store the ROM and GApps files.
- A USB cable and a computer to transfer the files to your device.
- A battery level of at least 50% to avoid any interruptions during the installation.

## Download LineageOS 21 and GApps for Redmi Note 5 Pro

You will need to download two files to install LineageOS 21 on your Redmi Note 5 Pro: the ROM zip file and the GApps zip file. GApps are the Google applications and services that are not included in the ROM by default, such as the Play Store, Gmail, Maps, etc. You can choose the variant of GApps that suits your needs, but we recommend the [NikGApps](^4^) package, which is optimized for LineageOS and offers a lot of customization options.

You can download the latest LineageOS 21 build for whyred from. The file name should be something like lineage-21.0-20240212-nightly-whyred-signed.zip, where the date may vary depending on when you download it.

You can download the latest LiteGapps package for Android 14 from [Here](https://litegapps.github.io). The file name should be something like litegapps.zip, where the variant (core, basic, omni, etc.) and the date may vary depending on your choice and when you download it.

Once you have downloaded both files, transfer them to your microSD card or USB OTG drive using your computer and USB cable. Make sure you remember the location where you stored them, as you will need to access them later.

## Install LineageOS 21 and GApps on Redmi Note 5 Pro

Now that you have everything ready, you can proceed with the installation of LineageOS 21 and GApps on your Redmi Note 5 Pro. Follow these steps carefully and do not skip any of them.
