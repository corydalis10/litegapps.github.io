### Material You Design Language Refinements

## Experience Android 14 on Redmi 4X with Custom ROMs

While official updates for the Redmi 4X may not include Android 14, enthusiasts can still enjoy the latest features and improvements through custom ROMs built on AOSP. By flashing a custom ROM based on Android 14, Redmi 4X users can breathe new life into their devices, experiencing the latest that Android has to offer.

### Steps to Flash a Custom ROM on Redmi 4X

1. **Unlock Bootloader**: Before flashing a custom ROM, ensure that the bootloader of your Redmi 4X is unlocked. This process varies depending on the device model and manufacturer, so be sure to follow the appropriate steps.

2. **Install Custom Recovery**: Install a custom recovery like TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project) on your Redmi 4X. Custom recovery allows you to flash custom ROMs and perform other advanced tasks on your device.

3. **Backup Your Data**: Before proceeding with flashing a custom ROM, it's essential to back up your data to prevent any loss of personal information.

4. **Download and Flash Custom ROM**: Download a custom ROM based on Android 14 for the Redmi 4X from a trusted source. Transfer the ROM file to your device, boot into recovery mode, and flash the ROM using the custom recovery.

5. **Install Google Apps (GApps)**: Most custom ROMs do not include Google Apps (GApps) by default due to licensing restrictions. After flashing the custom ROM, you'll need to install GApps separately to access Google services like the Play Store and Gmail.

6. **Reboot Your Device**: Once the custom ROM and GApps are successfully flashed, reboot your Redmi 4X. It may take some time for the device to boot up, so be patient.
