## Prerequisites:

1. **Unlock Bootloader:** Ensure your Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 bootloader is unlocked. This process wipes all data, so back up your important files.

3. **Battery:** Ensure your device has at least 50% battery to avoid interruptions during installation.

4. **Downloads:** Download the latest ArrowOS Android 13 ROM for Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 and transfer it to your device's internal storage.

## Installation Steps:

1. **Boot into Recovery Mode:** Power off your device, then press and hold Power and Volume Down simultaneously until the device boots into recovery mode.

2. **Backup:** (Optional but recommended) Create a Nandroid backup of your current ROM from the recovery menu to restore your device if needed.

4. **Flash ROM:** Navigate to the "Install" option, select the ArrowOS Android 13 zip file you transferred, then swipe to confirm the flash.
