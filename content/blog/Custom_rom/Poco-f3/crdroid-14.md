crDroid is a custom ROM based on Android 14 that aims to provide a stable and smooth experience with many features and customizations. It is one of the first ROMs to support the Poco F3, a flagship killer device with a Snapdragon 870 processor, a 120Hz AMOLED display, and a 48MP main camera. In this article, we will review the performance, battery life, camera quality, and user interface of crDroid on the Poco F3.

## Performance

crDroid is very fast and fluid on the Poco F3, thanks to the powerful hardware and the optimized software. The ROM boots up quickly and has no lag or stutter in daily usage. Apps load fast and multitasking is smooth, even with many apps running in the background. The ROM also handles gaming well, with high frame rates and no overheating issues. The ROM supports overclocking and underclocking the CPU and GPU, as well as changing the thermal profiles, for users who want to tweak the performance further.

## Battery Life

The battery life of crDroid on the Poco F3 is impressive, considering the high-end specs and the high refresh rate display. The ROM has a 4500 mAh battery that can easily last a full day of moderate to heavy usage, with screen-on time ranging from 6 to 8 hours. The ROM also supports fast charging, with a 33W charger that can charge the battery from 0 to 100% in about an hour. The ROM also has many battery saving features, such as adaptive brightness, dark mode, battery saver mode, and Doze mode, that can extend the battery life further.

## Camera Quality

The camera quality of crDroid on the Poco F3 is decent, but not outstanding. The ROM uses the stock MIUI camera app, which has a simple and intuitive interface, but lacks some features and modes that are available on other ROMs. The ROM can take good photos in daylight, with accurate colors, sharp details, and good dynamic range. However, the photos tend to lose quality in low-light conditions, with noise, grain, and loss of detail. The ROM also struggles with night mode, which often produces blurry and washed-out photos. The ROM can record 4K videos at 30fps, but the stabilization is not very effective. The ROM also has a 20MP selfie camera, which can take decent selfies, but with some skin smoothing and beautification effects.

## User Interface

The user interface of crDroid on the Poco F3 is clean and minimal, with a stock Android look and feel. The ROM has a Pixel Launcher, which has a Google feed on the left, an app drawer on the bottom, and a gesture navigation system. The ROM also has a quick settings panel, which has many toggles and shortcuts, and a notification shade, which has a smart reply feature. The ROM also has a settings app, which has many options and customizations, such as themes, fonts, icons, status bar, lock screen, gestures, buttons, and more. The ROM also has some extra features, such as face unlock, screen recorder, ambient display, and digital wellbeing.

## Conclusion

crDroid is a great ROM for the Poco F3, that offers a fast, smooth, and stable experience, with a long battery life and a clean user interface. The ROM also has many features and customizations, that can enhance the usability and functionality of the device. The ROM, however, has some drawbacks, such as the mediocre camera quality, the lack of some modes and features, and the occasional bugs and glitches. The ROM is still in development, and the developers are working hard to fix the issues and improve the ROM. If you are looking for a ROM that is close to stock Android, with a good balance of performance and battery life, crDroid is a good choice for you.
